# Scope
This project will test live traffic data through multiple platforms (API) for potential inclusion in VZ Viewer. 
#Scenario
The user can see the live condition of the traffic, search for places, and draw routes to check the underlying traffic conditions and toggle the route (hide/show).
# Hierarchy of documents
The number of files shows the process of completion. Smaller numbers preceded newer versions, and larger numbers were built on the previous versions. In the event of having contributors, traditional versioning will be applied.
